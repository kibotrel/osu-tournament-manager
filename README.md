## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project is set up as a monorepo, code is split into two main categories:

- `apps`: The client and server applications that ultimately make up the tournament manager.
- `packages`: Shared code between the client and server, such as types, utilities, and key systems isolated from the main applications to ease up maintenance and development.

More information about the architecture can be found in the [Architecture](./documentation/architecture/README.md) documentation.
